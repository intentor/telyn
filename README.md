# Telyn

## About

*Telyn* is a 2D side-scrolling platform game in which the player must use the power of the seasons to create/destroy and stop/move objects, created as a graduation assignment for the Digital Games Development course at [FATEC Carapicuíba](http://www.fateccarapicuiba.edu.br/) in 2011.

The game is based on Celtic Mythology, with a story of treason among gods and the journey of a druid trying to restore the harmony of the nature in our world.

The project is in Java 6 and all the comments and documentations are in Brazilian Portuguese.

*Telyn* uses [Slick2D](http://slick.ninjacave.com/) and [JBox2D](http://www.jbox2d.org/).

## Story

The War Goddesses did not agree with the irreverence of Men for the former Celtic gods. During the night of Samhain, taking advantage of the opening of the gates between the worlds, the goddesses Badb, Macha and Morrigan steal the Moons of the Seasons to destabilize the harmony of Our World and dive the days in a constant lifeless fog.

A Druid, carrying the Uaithne harp and with the help of the god Dagda, goes to the Otherworld to retrieve the Moons of the Seasons and so once again bring harmony to the nature in Our World.
